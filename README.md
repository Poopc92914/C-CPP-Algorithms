# C-CPP-Algorithms

## Description
This repository contains a collection of algorithmic challenges and problem-solving implementations in C and C++. Each solution is designed to be well-structured and easy to understand. This repository aims to improve coding skills, explore different problem-solving techniques, and build a strong foundation in C and C++ programming.

## Topics Covered
- **Mathematical Algorithms** (Prime numbers, GCD, LCM, etc.)
- **Sorting & Searching** (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search, etc.)
- **Data Structures** (Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, etc.)
- **Recursion & Backtracking**
- **Bit Manipulation**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph Algorithms**
- **String Algorithms** (Palindrome check, Anagram detection, etc.)
- **Number Manipulation** (Sum of digits, Reverse a number, etc.)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/C-CPP-Algorithms.git
2. Navigate to the desired algorithm folder.
3. Compile and run the C/C++ files using a compiler like GCC or Clang:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output
   
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
4. Modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.
